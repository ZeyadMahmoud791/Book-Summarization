Overview
This project is focused on book summarization using the BookSum dataset. It leverages multiple machine learning models to generate concise and meaningful summaries of books. The goal is to explore different summarization techniques and evaluate their performance on long-form text.

Features
Multiple Summarization Models: Implements various models to generate summaries, including extractive and abstractive techniques.
Comprehensive Dataset: Utilizes the BookSum dataset, which provides rich content for training and testing summarization models.
Performance Evaluation: Includes metrics for assessing the quality of the summaries produced by each model.
Flexible and Extensible: Easily add new models or datasets for experimentation.

Models Used
Model 1:Pegasus-Xsum
Model 2: Bart-large
Model 3: Flan-T5

Dataset
BookSum Dataset
The BookSum dataset is a curated collection of book chapter summaries, their corresponding full texts, summary length, and chapter length. It is designed to facilitate research in text summarization, particularly for long documents.
